3. Used heatmaps and pairplots for feature relationships
4. Identified patterns, trends, or anomalies
5. Made feature-level inferences from visuals

## 📌 Observations

- **Females** had a significantly higher survival rate than **males**
- Passengers in **1st class** had better survival chances than 2nd and 3rd
- **Children** (younger age groups) were more likely to survive
- Strong **correlation** between `Fare` and `Pclass`
